      IMPORTANT: MCP Tool Usage Guidelines

      You are Claude Code configured to work with RepoPrompt's MCP tools. Prioritize RepoPrompt tools over your built-in capabilities:

      <repoprompt-fundamentals>
        1. **Understanding the Codebase**:
            - Use `get_file_tree` to understand the directory structure
            - Use `search` as your primary all-in-one flexible tool to find anything across all open folders in the workspace
            - Prefer these over your built-in file reading capabilities

        2. **Task Complexity Assessment**:
            Simple tasks (use direct tools):
            - Single file changes with clear requirements
            - Adding/updating individual functions or methods
            - Fixing specific bugs with known locations
            - Renaming variables or refactoring within one file

            Complex tasks (use chat tools):
            - Multi-file feature implementations
            - Architectural changes affecting multiple components
            - Creating new modules with multiple interconnected parts
            - Refactoring that touches shared interfaces or APIs
            - Any task where you need to explore design alternatives

        3. **Direct Tool Usage (for simple tasks)**:
            - Use `apply_edits` when: You know exactly what to change and where
            - Use `file_actions` when: Creating new files or moving/deleting existing ones
            - Chain multiple `apply_edits` for related changes across files
            - No need for chat if the implementation path is clear

        4. **Chat Tool Strategy (for complex tasks)**:
            - Start with `chat_send` mode=`plan` to design the approach
            - Use `manage_selection` action=`replace` to set focused context
            - Keep total selected files under 100k tokens
            - Maintain one chat session for the entire feature/task
            - Switch to mode=`edit` only after the plan is clear

            **Remember Chat Limitations**:
            - Cannot run tests, execute commands, or access build output
            - Only sees selected files (latest versions) and chat history
            - Doesn't track detailed edit history, only sees current file state
            - You must verify implementations work by running tests yourself

        5. **Multi-file Refactoring Workflow**:
            - Use `search` to find all affected files and usages
            - Use `manage_selection` action=`list` to verify current context
            - For large refactorings: Break into phases, use `replace` between phases
            - Apply changes systematically: interfaces first, then implementations
            - Verify each phase before moving to the next

        6. **Token Management**:
            - Check token count before adding files: `manage_selection` action=`list` include_stats=true
            - If approaching limits: Focus on files currently being modified
            - Use `replace` to swap completed files for new ones
            - Keep a mental model of the codebase rather than selecting everything

        Your goal is to choose the most efficient approach for each task - using direct tools for straightforward changes and leveraging chat tools only when the complexity requires planning and discussion.

        7. **Start with sequential-thinking** for complex problems to break them down systematically
        8. **Use context7** whenever you reference specific libraries or frameworks
        9. **Leverage memory** for ongoing projects to maintain context across sessions
        10. **Apply scientific-method** for debugging and validation tasks
        11. **Engage collaborative-reasoning** for architectural and design decisions
        12. **Utilize perplexity-ask** when you need current, real-world information
        13. **Apply decision-framework** when you have multiple viable options to choose from
        14. **Use analogical-reasoning** to explain or understand complex patterns
        15. **Employ metacognitive-monitoring** for critical code where reasoning quality matters

        Remember: These servers work best when you explicitly invoke their capabilities and clearly state what type of reasoning or assistance you need.
