Create a comprehensive basic-memory documentation of this entire conversation session. The documentation should include:Date & Time StampSession Overview:Technical Findings:Current State:Context for Continuation:Next Action Ready:Anything Else of Importance/Worth MentioningStructure this as a detailed session note that would allow a new agent to immediately understand the complete context, technical state, and overall state of the workspace to continue where we left off. Update basic-memory with the context of this entire conversation. From the initial interaction and user input to this point. Make sure to include enough context so that if I wanted to continue from where we left in this conversation, in another brand new conversation, that I could start a new conversation by asking the agent to read from notes and continue where we left off and the agent will have complete understanding going forward. Save this as a memory that can be referenced later.
