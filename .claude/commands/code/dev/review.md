# Pre-PR Code Review Command

<instructions>
  <!-- ---------- 1. STATIC CONTEXT / SYSTEM PROMPT ---------- -->
  <context>
    A comprehensive pre-PR code review command that analyzes uncommitted changes against requirements to determine if the implementation is fit for purpose. Focuses primarily on requirements compliance with secondary checks for security, architecture, error handling, code quality, and performance issues. Designed to work without prior context by orienting itself through repo documentation and git status.
  </context>

  <!-- ---------- 2. OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS ---------- -->
  <requirements>
    - Accept primary input via $ARGUMENTS (can reference requirements location)
    - Support optional --requirements/-r flag for explicit requirements file path
    - Abort if no uncommitted changes or no requirements found
    - Read .claude/repo-context.md for repository orientation
    - Analyze ALL uncommitted changes (staged and unstaged) via git status/diff
    - PRIMARY FOCUS: Verify code changes meet stated requirements exactly as written
    - SECONDARY: Check for security, architecture, error handling, code quality, performance issues
    - Skip binary and generated files automatically
    - Prompt user if >50 files changed
    - Interactive error handling - prompt user on failures
    - Save report to .plan/03_code_review/ with auto-incremented filename (01_review.md, 02_review.md, etc.)
    - Use sub-agents for parallel analysis of different aspects
    - Show progress at milestones and current file being reviewed
    - Problem-focused output with brief acknowledgment of good aspects
  </requirements>

  <!-- ---------- 3. EXECUTION FLOW ---------- -->
  <execution>
    1. <init>
       - Parse $ARGUMENTS and --requirements flag
       - Validate requirements source exists
       - Check for uncommitted changes via git status
       - Abort if no changes or no requirements
       - Create .plan/03_code_review/ directory if needed
       - Determine next available filename prefix
    </init>

    2. <orient>
       - Read .claude/repo-context.md if exists
       - Understand repository structure and purpose
       - Note any architectural patterns or guidelines
    </orient>

    3. <gather_changes>
       - Run git status to identify changed files
       - Run git diff --cached for staged changes
       - Run git diff for unstaged changes
       - Filter out binary/generated files
       - If >50 files, prompt user to continue
       - Display "Analyzing X files..."
    </gather_changes>

    4. <load_requirements>
       - Read requirements from specified source
       - Parse requirements as-is (no interpretation)
       - Extract individual requirement items
       - Display "Loaded Y requirements..."
    </load_requirements>

    5. <parallel_analysis>
       - Spawn sub-agents concurrently:

       a) Requirements-Compliance-Agent:
          - Map each requirement to code changes
          - Identify fully implemented requirements
          - Flag partial implementations and TODOs
          - Find requirements with no changes
          - Detect scope creep (changes beyond requirements)

       b) Security-Review-Agent:
          - Scan for hardcoded credentials
          - Check for injection vulnerabilities
          - Identify insecure data handling
          - Review authentication/authorization

       c) Architecture-Review-Agent:
          - Check adherence to repo patterns
          - Identify architectural violations
          - Review module boundaries
          - Assess coupling and cohesion

       d) Code-Quality-Agent:
          - Find missing error handling
          - Detect code smells and duplication
          - Check function/class complexity
          - Review test coverage for changes
    </parallel_analysis>

    6. <synthesize_report>
       - Merge findings from all agents
       - Structure report with two main sections:
         * Issues by Severity (Critical ‚Üí High ‚Üí Medium ‚Üí Low)
         * Requirements Gaps and Missing Implementations
       - Include small code snippets for context
       - Use file:line references for large code blocks
       - Add brief "What's Good" summary at end
    </synthesize_report>

    7. <save_output>
       - Write report to .plan/03_code_review/XX_review.md
       - Display report to console
       - Show completion message with saved location
    </save_output>

  </execution>
